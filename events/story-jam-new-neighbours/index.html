        <h2 id="what-will-we-do">What will we do?</h2>
        <p class="f3">On 19-21 September Storytellers United organises Story Jam: New Neighbours, in cooperation with Sound &amp; Vision and the Netherlands Film Festival. During three days, you work together in multidisciplinary teams under the guidance of coaches on new intercultural story prototypes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The stories we will be developing are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Intercultural</strong>: developed with Dutch newcomers about the added value of cultural cross-pollination.</li>
          <li><strong>Interdisciplinary</strong>: told from the various expertises that team members bring together.</li>
          <li><strong>Innovative</strong>: experimental in the application of new technology and media for storytelling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each prototype casts a different light on the multicultural society of the Netherlands and uses the medium that best suits the makers and their story. Projects can for example take the form of a web experience, but also be VR, performance, app or installation. After three days of working together, the teams will share their results publicly during the Netherlands Film Festival.</p>
        <p>See <a href="#programme" class="su-dark-orange no-underline">an outline of the programme below</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="with-whom">With whom?</h2>
        <p>We warmly invite creatives of all professional backgrounds with an interest in innovative forms of storytelling to take part. Perhaps you do photography, develop websites, produce podcasts, make theatre, are into data visualisation, create immersive experiences in VR or AR, excel at designing user interfaces or you enjoy editing videos for online platforms. Whatever experience you bring, you certainly have an open mind and enjoy collaborating across disciplines.</p>
        <p>We especially encourage you to join if you have moved to the Netherlands from another country. With this Story Jam we want to build on the unique perspectives from people who are new to this country and celebrate intercultural collaboration, experiences and stories.</p>
        
        <h2 id="why-now">Why now?</h2>
        <p>Influenced by migratory flows, including wars, political unrest and climate crises, Dutch society is becoming increasingly diverse. Story Jam: New Neighbours focuses on new stories from these multicultural communities and the social and economic value they bring to the table. How can we support each other and what can these connections and collaborations bring? How can we celebrate social and cultural richness? What can different backgrounds learn from each other? And how can intercultural stories help?</p>
        <p>With this Story Jam, we want to challenge stereotypes and expose commonly held myths, put migrants' voices at the centre of discussions about migration and deliver innovative messages to promote the integration of Dutch newcomers into local communities.</p>

            <p class="f5">The <a class="su-dark-orange hover-no-underline" href="https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en" Sound &amp; Vision</a> in Hilversum manages one of the world's largest digitised media archives for radio, television, YouTube videos, objects, written press, podcasts and games. They preserve the daily growing media collection as heritage for eternity. At the same time, they closely follow all movements in the global media landscape, including developments in the online and digital domain.</p>
            <p class="f5">The starting point for all activities of Sound and Vision is the importance of free media for our democracy, to contribute to an open, free, inclusive and media-minded society. They illuminate current affairs from a media-historical perspective and show how you yourself can use media to tell your story, but they also show the influence of media on your personal life and on society. They do this in various ways: online and in the museums in Hilversum and The Hague, but also at partner locations. At schools, they offer a wide range of workshops on media literacy and they also stimulate academic and journalistic research. As an organisation or in cooperation with universities, festivals, organisations at home and abroad as well as relevant companies, they organise countless public activities, workshops, debates and lectures for young and old - and now also this Story Jam.</p>

            <p class="f5"><a class="su-dark-orange hover-no-underline" href="https://www.filmfestival.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Netherlands Film Festival</a> (NFF) is involved in this project as a platform. One of its pillars is the Digital Culture Programme. Like SU and parts of Beeld &amp; Geluid, this department focuses on the development of alternative forms of Storytelling, in which technology and new media play a role. It takes a critical look at the social impact and possibilities of technology and the opportunities this offers for new forms of storytelling. The target groups are festival visitors and filmmakers interested in innovation, as well as digital artists engaged in narrative productions.</p>
            <p class="f5">By providing a venue for this Story Jam, NFF wants to give a new impulse to the professional field in the Netherlands. It wants to be an inspiring platform and stage for up-and-coming talent and inspire new makers by bringing in national and international experts and opening up new networks.</p>
