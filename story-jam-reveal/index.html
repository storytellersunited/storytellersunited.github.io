          <p class="f3">
            On 15 - 17 September Storytellers United organises Story Jam:
            REVEAL, in cooperation with IMPAKT, Mezrab, the World Makers
            Foundation, Sound &amp; Vision and the Netherlands Film Festival.
            During three days, you work together in multidisciplinary teams
            under the guidance of mentors on new innovative story
            prototypes.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>The stories we will be developing are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Interdisciplinary</strong>: combining the various
              expertises that team members bring to the table.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Innovative</strong>: experimental in the application of
              new technology and media for storytelling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Investigative</strong>: under the theme REVEAL: The secret
              life of media, we will explore how storytelling can act as a
              powerful tool to help uncover hidden structures behind the media
              we use every day.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Projects developed at Story Jam cast a light on invisible technical
            and social processes that underlie the media landscape we are
            immersed in. Every project uses the medium that best suits the
            makers and their story, and could for example take the form of a web
            experience, but also be VR, performance, app or installation. After
            three days of working together, teams will share their results
            publicly during the Netherlands Film Festival Professionals
            Programme.

            We warmly invite creatives of all professional backgrounds with an
            interest in innovative forms of storytelling to take part. Perhaps
            you do photography, develop websites, produce podcasts, make
            theatre, are into data visualisation, create immersive experiences
            in VR or AR, excel at designing user interfaces or you enjoy editing
            videos for online platforms. Whatever experience you bring, you
            certainly have an open mind and enjoy collaborating across
            disciplines.

They do this in various ways: online and in the museums in Hilversum and The Hague, but also at partner locations. At schools, they offer a wide range of workshops on media literacy and they also stimulate academic and journalistic research.

              <p class='f5'>In 2017 Karim Adduchi and Ann Cassano worked together on a project to engage refugee and migrant artisans on Karim‚Äôs new collection ‚ÄòShe Has 99 Names.‚Äô Noticing the particular strengths and challenges of this group, they decided to take the project further. The result is <a class='su-dark-orange hover-no-underline' href='https://www.theworldmakers.org/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>The World Makers Foundation</a>. The organisation supports refugee and migrant artisans, building upon the creativity and heritage they bring with them, and provide a platform for their skills. They collaborate with local, established artists and designers, as well as with cultural institutions. The foundation works with social designers and systemic-change practitioners, using fashion as a means to connect people and build community.</p>
